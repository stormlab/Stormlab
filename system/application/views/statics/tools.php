	<p>The Carbon CMS (Content Management System), Mercury Blog and Silver Slideshow are modular components that we have developed to help our clients take control of their web sites after they&#8217;ve been launched. You can use these tools together or individually. We can customize each oneÂ depending on your requirements. Check out the examples to see how or clients have already put the Elements Suite to work.</p>
	
	<h3>Carbon Content Management System (CMS)</h3>
	<div class="image_column"><?php echo img_tag('tools_cms.jpg'); ?></div>
	<p>On the web, content is everything. We have created a simple, custom Content Management System that allows you to edit text, insert pictures, format layouts, add pages and sections - wherever, whenever and however you want. Carbon generates web-standard, XHTML/CSS, search-engine friendly code so you don&#8217;t have to. You cannot break your web site using Carbon.</p>
	<p>Examples: <?php echo anchor('portfolio/sort/all/#pljv','PLJV'); ?>, <?php echo anchor('portfolio/sort/all/#desi-hits','Desi Hits'); ?></p>
	
	<h3>Mercury Blog</h3>
	<div class="image_column"><?php echo img_tag('tools_blog.jpg'); ?></div>
	<p>Stormlab can show you the power of blogging with our Mercury Blogging Engine or, if you prefer we can customize WordPress to suit your needs. We can help you integrate a blog as part of a unified, online marketing strategy that can significantly boost your search engine ranking through targeted search engine optimization.</p>
	<p>Examples: <?php echo anchor('portfolio/sort/all/#climate360','Climate360'); ?></p>
	
	<h3>Silver Slideshow</h3>
	<div class="image_column"><div id="slideshow" style="border : 5px solid #999;width:372px;height:242px;"></div></div>
	<p>Silver Slideshow is a fast and easy way to put dynamic visual content anywhere on your site. A lot of our clients use it as the main feature on their homepage (we&#8217;ve used it on ours). Others have created slideshows of client logos.</p>
	<p>Silver slideshows use Flash to create dynamic transitions (fade, wipe or blur). They can be any size and you control the length of the slideshow. All the slides are JPGs and can be managed manually or via the Carbon CMS.</p>
	<p>Examples: <?php echo anchor('portfolio/sort/all/#st-davids','St. David&#8217;s'); ?>, <?php echo anchor('portfolio/sort/all/#iptivia','Iptivia'); ?>, <?php echo anchor('portfolio/sort/all/#nuenergen','NuEnergen'); ?></p>
