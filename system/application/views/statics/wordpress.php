	<h3 id="blog">Blog</h3>

	<p>Did you know blogging can significantly impact your company&#8217;s search engine ranking? Because blog postings are heavily linked to one another, search engines will look upon that content as being more important. The result: smart Companies are using blogs strategically for search placement. </p>

	<p>A good blog helps you become established as an expert in your field. When you offer solid advice, you stay top-of-mind among your potential customers and present opportunities for them to make a buying decision. Focus also increases instances of certain words throughout your blog, i.e. &#8216;Computer&#8217;, &#8216;Hardware&#8217;. The more times these phrases occur (naturally) throughout your postings, the more likely it is that the search engines will rank you under those terms. </p>

	<p>According to Digg, WordPress is the number one blogging platform in the world. And according to Technorati, more than a third of the top 100 blogs use it. It&#8217;s open-source, widely used and it&#8217;s free. Because of it&#8217;s popularity, there are thousands of developers creating plugins that can be used to greatly expand the platform. There are plugins that integrate Adsense, plugins that create XML Sitemaps and many, many more. Our experience in customizing and combining plugins, widgets and themes is what we use to create the other applications listed on this page.</p>

	<h3 id="magazine_news_site">Magazine/News Site</h3>

	<p>Magazines and News Sites are basically blogs on steroids so it&#8217;s no surprise that WordPress makes an excellent base upon which to build. With a team of authors it&#8217;s easy to create a portal around technology, the environment or anything else you care to think of. Because there are five levels of users - Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, and Subscriber - you can easily accommodate a wide variety of editorial roles. </p>

	<h3 id="cms_content_management_system">CMS (Content Management System)</h3>

	<p>Having a Content Management System or CMS empowers you and members of your team to actively update the contents of your site by yourselves without the intervention of a developer. This is especially useful in companies that make frequent updates to a bio page for example, or need to regularly upload files for clients or customers to use. </p>

	<p>The built-in &#8216;Pages&#8217; functionality WordPress can be used as a flexible and expandable CMS. Each page can be supplemented with customizable navigation and sidebars. The central media management interface allows you to link to PDFs or resize images on the fly. Adding new content from the WordPress dashboard is simple and straightforward. </p>

	<h3 id="e_commerce_store">E-Commerce Store</h3>

	<p>Adding a shopping cart to WordPress is a great option for small companies with a few products (such as t-shirts, hats, stickers or ebooks etc) that they want to be able to sell without the hassle of a major e-commerce system. Integrating with PayPal or Authorize.net is secure and surprisingly easy. Once the payment gateway has been established we can set up an AJAX shopping cart that will handle the purchase process safely and easily.</p>

	<h3 id="crm_customer_relationship_management">CRM (Customer Relationship Management)</h3>

	<p>It&#8217;s easy to gather up user data: as visitors make purchases (see previous), fill in a contact form or request an email newsletter subscription. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you could collect all of those details in a single database â€“ accessible from anywhere? We can build a system that will do just that. Employees with appropriate credentials can even add the details of people they&#8217;ve spoken to over the phone - via a custom dashboard. In turn, some or all of your contacts can then be ported over to a third party email service such as MailChimp or Campaign Monitor and turned into recipients for an email blast.</p>

	<h3 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h3>

	<p>Photographers, architects and even web designers can benefit from a portfolio section on their website that showcases their work. By retrofitting the blog portion of a site we can allow posts that become gallery entries. The Post title becomes the entry name and the Post body becomes the entry&#8217;s description. Images are then added via the WordPress Media Manager.</p>

	<h3 id="review_site">Review Site</h3>

	<p>Review sites can be tailored to virtually any niche from restaurants to debates. Regular blog posts can be used as the editorial reviews and the addition of a rating system allows users to interact with the review process and indicate what their favorites are.</p>

	<h3 id="social_network">Social Network</h3>

	<p>WordPress MU (multi-user) makes it possible for anyone with a website to host their own blogging community, and to control and moderate all the blogs within that community. From the central dashboard it is possible to moderate and control various settings for all your users. Add to this forums, messaging, extended profiles, friends, groups and activity and you have your very own Facebook.</p>

	<h3 id="community_news_site">Community News Site</h3>

	<p>Over time, blogs like WordPress build up a natural following of users who are often willing to contribute news and posts. This is a great way to outsource some of the volume of relevant content for a blog. It also helps foster a feeling of inclusiveness and participation.</p>

	<h3 id="membership_directory">Membership Directory</h3>

	<p>A membership directory is a site that allows people to create a personal profile. For example, a Community News Site might use this to create a directory of contributors, their backgrounds and interests. Or small businesses could sign up and create a business listing with company background and images.</p>

	<h3 id="event_calendar">Event Calendar</h3>

	<p>For many organizations it&#8217;s important to be able to show when events, seminars or gatherings are taking place in order to foster a physical community around their service or product. Adding a calendar or event listing within WordPress allows companies to keep site visitors abreast of what&#8217;s happening, when and where.</p>

	<h3 id="video_portal">Video Portal</h3>

	<p>Sites like YouTube have done a great deal to popularize video on the web. For businesses, video can be a great way to put a face on a company and it can be used for software screencasts, complex tutorials or conference coverage. Setting up a video portal is extremely straightforward when you&#8217;re using third-party video sites like Vimeo or Blip.tv. These sites allow you embed your videos into WordPress using the regular embed code that they provide. </p>

	<h3 id="mobile_site">Mobile Site</h3>

	<p>With smart phones becoming increasing mainstream it makes sense to provide web content in a tailored format that phones can interpret. By specifically developing a mobile version of your theme you can stand out from the competition and show users that you are attuned to their specific information needs.</p>

	<h3 id="premium_content_site">Premium Content Site</h3>

	<p>A premium membership site is one where visitors pay either a subscription or one-off fee to access special members-only content. This can be especially useful if you have valuable content such as White Papers that you don&#8217;t want to just give away. WordPress can be used to build a premium membership site by modifying the built-in membership system and creating &#8216;member&#8217;s only&#8217; sections which can only be accessed after a new member has paid for their account. Of course, new members don&#8217;t necessarily have to pay, but if what you have is valuable information a premium membership is a useful way to gather demographic information on sales leads. </p>

	<h3 id="twitter_clone">Twitter Clone</h3>

	<p>With the right plugins and a little creativity you can turn Wordpress into a pseudo-Twitter; which is a great for enhancing communication within a team and a good example of just how flexible the WordPress engine is. It works best with a group of 20 or less.</p>
