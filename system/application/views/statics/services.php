	<div class="image_column"><?php echo img_tag('services_ia.jpg'); ?></div>
	<p>Typically, we begin our projects with a pad of paper and a pencil, mapping out the structure of a site or application in the form of a flowchart. This is the <em>big picture</em>; and it helps us think about the ways in which elements of the site will interact.</p>
	<p>From the flowchart, we move to detailed <em>grey box</em> diagrams. These are the precursors to the actual design and we use them to establish what&#8217;s on each page and how these elements are tied together.</p>
	
	<h3>Design</h3>

	<p>In addition to being well planned, Stormlab sites are attractive to look at. That&#8217;s because we pride ourselves on having the highest design standards. We take meticulous care crafting sites that express our clients brand perfectly.</p>
	<p><?php echo anchor('portfolio','Check out the Portfolio'); ?> for examples of our design work.</p>
	
	<h3>Programming</h3>
	<div class="image_column"><?php echo img_tag('services_prog.jpg'); ?></div>
	<p>From simple static websites to complex applications that handle video, audio, live streaming data and much more we have the programming chops to handle it all.</p>
	<p>All of our websites are coded using web standard XHTML and CSS. For sites that need dynamic interactivity we use javascript and AJAX. And on larger, more complex projects requiring database functionality we use PHP and MySQL.</p>
	<p>In order to speed development and keep our practice as efficient as possible we utilize two coding frameworks: CodeIgniter and Ruby On Rails.</p>
	<p><?php echo anchor('portfolio','Check out an example of our web apps'); ?> in the portfolio.</p>
	
	<h3>Illustration</h3>
	<div class="image_column"><?php echo img_tag('services_ill.jpg'); ?></div>
	<p>Illustration is a great way to create a truly unique web site. From singular icons to truly immersive online experiences, our illustrations have helped clients stand out from the pack.</p>
	<p>Check out the <?php echo anchor('portfolio','Portfolio'); ?> for examples of our illustrations.</p>
	
	<h3>Flash/Interactive</h3>
	<div class="image_column"><?php echo img_tag('services_flash.jpg'); ?></div>
	<p>In addition to our programming services, we also offer Flash design and coding. Previous projects include dynamic visualizations of complex concepts in Education, Flash advertising and slideshows.</p>
	
	<h3>Project Management</h3>
	<div class="image_column"><?php echo img_tag('services_manage.jpg'); ?></div>
	<p>All of our planning, design and coding activities are co-ordinated via Basecamp. Basecamp is the design-industry standard for web-based project management. Clients can access Basecamp at any time in order to track our progress and collaborate with us as we realize their web sites for them.</p>
